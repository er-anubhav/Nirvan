## 📋 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+ and npm
- Bun (optional but recommended for faster installation)

### Setup Steps

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Bun (faster)
bun install
```

2. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000  # Backend API URL
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# OR using Bun
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

4. **Build for production**

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# OR using Bun
bun run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.
